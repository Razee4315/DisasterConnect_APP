## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in DisasterConnect, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Please include the following in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce

- Suggested fix (if any)

## Response Timeline

- Acknowledgment within 48 hours
- Initial assessment within 1 week
- Fix or mitigation as soon as reasonably possible

## Scope

This policy applies to the DisasterConnect desktop application and its source code. Third-party dependencies are managed through their own security channels.

## Disclosure

Once a vulnerability is fixed, we will:

1. Release a patched version
2. Document the fix in the release notes
3. Credit the reporter (unless they prefer to remain anonymous)
